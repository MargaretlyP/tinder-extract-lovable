=== Tinder Conversation ===


--- 2025-03-03 ---

[13:42] You: Heya!

I have a yoga streak and love it!

[13:43] You: 70 days already! 

Love this small ritual every morning at home :) 

Would love to go to yoga classes 🥵💥

[16:47] Margaret: Hi, That’s impressive! Yoga is a body’s lifestyle so it’s great that is getting to mainstream 😇

[16:48] Margaret: Have you ever been on hot yoga?

[16:49] You: yeah, way of life! My diet became so so much better!

[16:49] You: No, but I’m curious and want to try!

[16:53] Margaret: I like your optimism! I was going to one studio but it’s super girly. Like even to girly for me ;) so I’m looking for another one

[16:56] You: I like it too, almost everything can become an opportunity to grow if I’m willing to see :)

Haha I imagine! I usually practice yoga home but I would love to go somewhere cuz I started to work more from home. So it’s refreshing to change the scene and meet nice people!

[16:57] You: Any ideas for the studios?

I can look if you need an extra set of hands 🙂‍↔️

[17:04] Margaret: That kind of approach is so refreshing, it’s simple and deep at the same time! Did you build/polish your mindset or it was always a part of your personality?

[17:05] Margaret: Case with hot studio looks like… there is no other studios 😂 But what do you think about Pilates? There is one studio that has chillates (yes!) and it spoke to me.

[17:05] Margaret: Yoga beat studio on śródmieście

[17:12] You: I think I always had the potential but I built it from scratch with a lot of effort and discipline!

I always wanted to be an entrepreneur. After trials and errors, I understand that it first happens in the mind, it needs to be prepared and be resilient and handle uncertainty and risks! 

So I kind of had and still have a driving force that pushes me :) 

Thanks for asking, fun and refreshing to talk with you

[17:13] You: Yeah, let's try! When do you want to go? 

I sometimes do pilates at home when my core is not protesting loud enough haha

[18:22] Margaret: I adore when other person is opening their mind. Showing how they operating, it speak louder than simple answer for direct question aka who are you? So cliche question by the way.

[18:24] Margaret: I’m curious how you would describe ‘driving force’. Is something more than motivation, is like pushing into your work of life path? Or more like: you know that’s your only option to live.

This topic is on my mind on repeat, these days.

[18:25] Margaret: Getting back to Pilates. These classes that I’ve referred back then, they are only in Mondays 😇

[18:34] You: Yeah, I also adore it. Actually, I don't think that actual thoughts are as important as intrinsic beliefs and motivations that lie behind them. 


Also, imagine when you meet such a person and THEN you see that his (her) actions align with what you heard.

Omg I’ll just fall in love. These people are gold and rare like diamonds.

[18:40] You: It’s more like the only option to live for me. 

Motivation often implies reliance on external (people, circumstances, places).

My driving force was the intense pain and discomfort I experienced from my early years. 

I felt that either it would break me down or help me find myself and my place in the world. 

That's the difference for me between both. 

When we meet can you tell me more about what’s on your mind?

[18:40] You: Of course, we can meet on Monday then 🙂‍↔️

[19:56] Margaret: Regarding your first thought, you transferred what I felt into one simple reflexion. Chapeau bas! It’s all about alignment. So clever. 

Motivation is a weird creature. More I’m thinking about it, I feel like it doesn’t exist for me. As you said, is external source so pretty unstable.

[19:58] Margaret: I’ll leave you a teaser of my mind before Monday. First floor of my mind palace, or maybe not floor (it’s sounds like a foundation) so first room. Okey?

[21:08] You: Perfect, you have an impeccable mastery of words! Very intricate and precise. 

What exists then for you? What’s inside?

[21:09] You: Mind palace, wow!

What does this room look like? Anyone or anything else there?


--- 2025-03-04 ---

[13:14] Margaret: Thank u! What is my driving force? First bullet in my head was showing: fulfillment. I know that I have a mission to put an impact into the world. Leave something behind cuz I have natural resources.

Tricky part is in the search period of that thing. But! I feel like with each my decision the path seems more clear. Not like Labirynth but more like a path from The Wizard of Oz.

[13:15] Margaret: This is one of the rooms, I left it today with new decision.

[13:17] Margaret: It’s funny how saying to someone - NO is saying - YES to yourself.

[13:18] Margaret: I put Monday into my calendar 😇

[15:10] You: This is deep on so many levels. I rarely meet people who question themselves so honestly and wholeheartedly. And  also artistically!

[15:10] You: What was your decision if I may ask?

[15:11] You: Me too, but what’s the actual time for the chilates? :)

[16:53] Margaret: You made me blush, thank u!
I started thinking, what are people doing when they don’t reflect on themselves?

Open question, I guess.

[17:03] Margaret: Decision. I’ve decided to end one of my business partnerships. Ending something with people who I’m admiring but their business is not my typ… is hard.

[17:05] Margaret: Chillates (love that name, btw!) is at 20:00

[17:08] You: Just the truth!

Distract themselves, tell sweet and pleasant truths, numb the discomfort, bury its inside…Many ways, you can be creative with this stuff!

[17:11] You: I made a similar decision lately. But my reason was that our relationship was more like employer/employee and I needed a partner. 

I dragged this relationship for some time because I was afraid to hurt this guy. 

In the end, I realized I had to make tough decisions ASAP and people-pleasing just stops me.

[17:12] You: okey, good timing, now in my calendar

[17:13] You: Pure pleasure to discuss it with you!

[20:14] Margaret: Numb the discomfort. It’s crazy how brain prefer know ‘hell’ than unknown ‘heaven’. Neuroscience is more than interesting!

[20:19] Margaret: Dealing with people who are more than ‘work’, I mean that we have some relationship with them - is challenging. 

I’m thinking, isn’t more painful for other person that we are keeping the state of matter. We can feel (us humans) when something is not ok.

When we flipped the coin, people pleasing might work at the opposite. Hmm… I’m still processing this so you know, it’s open statement ;)

[20:20] Margaret: Pleasure is working in both sides! Tinder is such a weird place, isn’t it?


--- 2025-03-05 ---

[09:48] You: Yes, agree about the unknown. I guess what makes uncertainty so scary is that it reflects one’s psyche, especially its dark parts. Biggest fears, regrets, grievances. 

So I can understand why brain tries to avoid ambiguity:)

[09:49] You: Yes, it’s indeed challenging!

Makes sense. I kept the state of affairs because I thought the person could push through the discomfort and grow. It didn’t happen!

People pleasing can be a liability and manipulation :)

[09:50] You: I’m delighted :) 

Yeah, weird, wouldn't have thought I had such a conversation!

[12:47] Margaret: Do you know that your copy skills are impeccable with splash of extravagance? It’s really a pleasure to read reflections written that way. 

And yeah, I’m a queen of feedback. That’s my super power! But I can’t keep it only for myself. I believe that this way world will be a better place.

[12:50] Margaret: Regarding dark places. Today I’ve listened to a podcast and one phrase sticked with me. How not putting reflector, light on our dark parts is making us less mature. Or maybe in other words, how it limits our ability to experience the world.

[12:52] Margaret: People pleasing as a form of manipulation. Hmm… Could you elaborate more on that?

[14:52] You: I’m touched and it’s a timely praise of my skills. I’m now focused on sales and marketing. 

So this is just in time 😍

[14:53] You: Understood, my queen. What shall your subject do for your kindness? 

😝

[14:54] You: One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. (Carl Jung)

This is the phrase I’ve been reflecting for months. And it’s similar to what you heard on the podcast!

[14:56] You: Sure!

This kind of behavior often entails:

Alteration of behavior 

Desire to get approval or avoid conflict 

And in return it can create a sense of obligation in others.

[17:50] Margaret: You are working on full BDSM? (Business, development, sales and marketing) 🌚

[17:53] Margaret: Hmm… let me think. Feedback almost always transfer into product/service development. And that means better quality = scaling, so growth. So my subject could manage that growth. Makes sense?

[17:58] Margaret: Cool guy from this Carl. I’m curios one thing. Do you feel that showing, touching, observing these dark parts and then sharing with close friends changed dynamic/matureness of yours friendship?

[17:59] Margaret: In fact, the question is not if but how.

[18:00] Margaret: Thank you for the last part, I will stole this to my private notes 😎

[18:02] Margaret: Small offtop. Today’s sunset, it was more than breathtaking. I left the office and felt like I couldn’t move my eyes from it.

[20:27] You: What jargon, I used to this word in another circumstances! No, for the agency I do sales and technical. For the product, I also do sales and also marketing and also a bit technical.

[20:28] You: Yeah, that makes sense. Will do :)

[20:29] You: Yeah, it changed! My relationship deepened. I can say friends I love them, have better trust. 

They are more open to what I do for them. 

It is worth it 100%.

[20:30] You: I also keep my notes for the last couple of years!

[20:31] You: Yes and yes! I felt awe and appreciation for today's weather :)

[22:57] Margaret: Happy to hear that (regarding friends), what changed my view is that showing to other person your insecurities/dark parts is making you stronger, not weaker. But it’s fcking scary at the begging!

[22:59] Margaret: Yes, it’s 12pm and I’m here. Not my normal style but I’ve just finished a call which started joga classes and end by valuation of carpenters 😂


--- 2025-03-06 ---

[04:38] You: Yes, it makes it that way. But not sure only at the beginning. I did it yesterday and it was still scary 😂

[04:40] You: Occasional deviations from routines are good for the brain and body :) 

And yours also seems fun!

I've had a similar experience with my friends, we talked for almost four hours 😂

[04:40] You: Enjoy your day :)

[10:03] You: But what about you? you have experience in sales?

I’m setting up a sales process right now and doing first sales by myself. But then plan to hire someone. 

I’m willing to learn and get feedback :)

[11:53] Margaret: Maybe it will always be scary? Who said that this feeling will be replaced? Being human is hard 😂

[11:54] Margaret: Great to hear that! Having friends with whom you are able to talk straight for few hours is achievement.

That’s the gold of this world.

[11:56] Margaret: And yes, I believe that some touch of diversity is good, once again. Neuroplasticity. 

But… sleep is out of this box, in my opinion on 3.6.25 at 12:56, maybe tomorrow I will reconsider it. Hope I do.

[11:57] Margaret: I’m always thinking, I want to meet a people who are waking up at 5am. And here I am!

[12:01] Margaret: Regarding sales, that’s the good question! I would like to be humble and say, my experience is passive. 

During my work for AI startup, I was in a lot of processes. For example transferring product to client B2B. In this project that I’m finishing right now, I’m also involve with creating B2B platform and I’m observing a lot in different sales processes. 

I feel that here I have some gap.

[12:06] Margaret: Wow! I mean that’s fucking great that you are able to create it and validate a process by yourself. 

I’m curious, how time consuming is it?
And secondly, what group of clients do you targeting with these sales? How specific is it?

[16:31] You: It will be, I think I’m very close to accepting it with all my soul. More chances our work is replaced dy AI 😂

[16:33] You: Yes, gold of this world.

Recently one of my friends said he loves me. And another said that everywhere I can be I will always create an orchard.  That I can create something meaningful whenever I am physically.

This was deep.

[16:34] You: Hahah speaking of sleep, yeah, that's me!

I’m def an early person. 

And what about you?

[16:35] You: I also have some gaps which I filling dynamically :)

Learn by doing, best form of studying 📑

[16:36] You: I work 12-14 hours per day and also Saturdays, sometimes Sundays!

I want outstanding results in next 10 years, so they require outstanding efforts. That’s how I think :)

[16:37] You: For agency I target small business owners with high-frequency inbound and outbound calls. 

For product, plus minus the same. But I decided to drill down to specific niches.

So today I programmatically created niche-specific landing pages



[18:46] You: I’ve just fed all my notes into LLM and asked it to tell about me 😂

wanna look? :)

[20:48] Margaret: Starting from the end. More than yes!

[20:51] Margaret: Ive started falling into this tool recently. Especially with my reflections. I love that it can make a dialog/podcast about you.

[20:55] Margaret: Okey, now I have a space to properly read your message. That was crazy day. I bought plane tickets to Malta!

[20:58] Margaret: Statement regarding friends, oh dear lord. That’s really deep. First that they are sharing huge emotions, and they are able to admit it. Secondly, the lvl of concrete. More than wow.

[21:02] Margaret: How people are able to learn without doing? Like how?? It’s pointless but… i guess it’s their purpose 😂

[21:08] Margaret: 12–14 h it sounds like a work of life. There is beauty in it, but I guess each coin could be flipped ;)

[21:12] Margaret: Working on weekends is kinda normal in my bubble. For example I always like to do creative stuff, strategies. That’s the best time slot for me.

[21:12] Margaret: But it doesn’t mean that sometimes I adore having empty weekends!

[21:13] Margaret: Before I will go to landings

[21:16] Margaret: Funny story. The website that I’m polishing right know it’s also on vercel 😂

[21:18] Margaret: I’m curious, how you estimated x of increase bookings for each niche.


--- 2025-03-07 ---

[14:14] You: 

it both praised me and roasted me huh

[14:14] You: which tool are you referring to, Margaret?

[14:15] You: Hooray, when is your flight?

[14:15] You: Each coin could be flipped and what will be on the visible side then? :)

[14:16] You: what’s the website you have on Vercel?

I like this platform’

[14:16] You: rough estimate! I had a calculator and made a guess based off that!

[17:11] Margaret: Oh… I read some parts and I felt like I shouldn’t read them. It’s so intimate to go into someone’s head. 

I’m processing a lot know, you know subconsciously cuz I feel empty head at the same time.

[17:15] Margaret: What’s funny that in summary is the same dilemma I’m dealing with: ‘…your execution and material success don't match your potential.’

What kind of blockage or limiting beliefs are causing this? Have you solve it? Do you have some insights?

[17:17] Margaret: Question for me is: Why I felt so odd stepping in your privacy?

[17:17] Margaret: Right now. I feel mentally overstimulated. I don’t know where I’m heading. Home but still it’s feels odd

[17:19] You: You need to rest.

Bath, yoga, some quiet time.

I feel the same way. So I do some physical exercises, then shower and have dinner somewhere nice

[17:19] Margaret: That’s was quick 😅

[17:20] Margaret: I will go for a walk. I’m not ready to go home yet. No. I need walk.

[17:20] You: This is a good choice

[17:20] You: I had a walk three hours ago

[17:21] Margaret: Walk is solution for everything, right?

[17:23] Margaret: There is few open items At the top. I will respond later :) better to not be killed

[17:23] You: this is so, a solution :)

[17:24] You: don’t worry about that please, we’ll talk about all we need :)

it will be easy and naturally!

[17:25] Margaret: Oh, I’m not worrying ;) I was just in playful mood and now I switched to philosophical

[17:26] You: we need a toggle switch for your moods here in UI 🤭

[17:26] Margaret: Hahaha

[17:27] Margaret: Tinder is not advance yet but one day, who knows.

[17:27] You: but we help it

[17:27] You: and train on our data

[17:27] You: haha

[17:28] Margaret: We cracked their algorithm

[17:28] Margaret: ‘To Genius conversation’

[17:28] Margaret: Too*

[17:29] Margaret: Error XYZ

[17:29] You: please debug and fix

[17:30] Margaret: No problem: Do you like dogs?

[17:30] Margaret: Or other shit questions people love to ask here

[17:33] You: Dear product team,

please add a new state “Normal” for the toggle switcher in the chat with a beautiful and funny girl I’m chatting here with

[17:34] You: But yeah, I like :)

[18:08] You: i also came for a walk!

[18:10] Margaret: Someone is doubling his points. Too fast. Nununu! 😅

[18:10] Margaret: Normal, I don’t recall that word. Do you?

[18:10] Margaret: Hot girl walk, I guess!

[18:11] You: I will proceed with caution 🤭

[18:11] You: I need to check my logs, please wait…

[18:12] You: Hahaha I can’t understand if I understand your last message. But if I understand 🫨

[18:13] You: how possible u think for us to meet each other?

[18:14] Margaret: We are going to on Monday!

[18:14] Margaret: Do you think that I wasn’t serious?

[18:15] You: Oh no, we both were serious. No doubts in that!

I was just half-joking how likely it is for us to meet during our walks

[18:16] Margaret: Hmm… Actually, 1 km away is quite close

[18:16] Margaret: I’m curious if this data is accurate or not

[18:17] You: i think 1km is minimum for security reasons

[18:17] You: i’m on stalowa 1 close to wileńska

[18:17] Margaret: Hahah

[18:17] Margaret: Too close

[18:17] Margaret: I guess

[18:18] You: less then 1 km right?

[18:18] Margaret: Should I ask you: Are you stalking me? 😅

[18:19] You: oh my gos no

[18:19] You: god no

[18:20] You: we can easily switch theme

[18:20] You: i’m doing groceries, didn’t think twice about

[18:21] You: I had a fast and intense day, quick decisions and emotionally sometimes overwhelming.

Should have switched my mode, I’m sorry

[18:21] You: direct question is appreciated and safety comes first

[18:22] Margaret: Easy, I was laughing because I was there like 20 min ago. So that’s funny

[18:26] Margaret: I think that we shouldn’t be sorry, we are only human, right? 

Regarding decisions, right know I’m reading The Alamanck of Naval Ravikant.

btw, I feel like this book is feeling my mentors gap that I have right know.

Back to the story, today’s part was about decisions.

[18:27] Margaret: ‘If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.’

[18:33] Margaret: I adore that you are checking if we are on the same page (corpo sentence but it’s hitting the point). Communication is everything!

[18:57] You: It wasn’t so funny to me tbh 😫

I felt sad that i could have made you feel scared or anxious. But yeah, we are waking on the same roads!

[18:59] You: Well said. For me usually for important decisions clarity comes after I spent time with pain and reflected on it.

pain + reflection = progress 

In regards to Naval Ravikant following stuff stayed with me for years:

- set up an hourly rate and don’t do anything below it

- choose desires wisely and limit them 

- Four types of leverage:

1. Labour
2. Capital
3. Code
4. Content

Also I think we have AI now (can be classified as code though)

[19:00] You: Yeah, comms are important ;)

[19:22] Margaret: Now I saw: feeling mentor 😂😂

[19:22] Margaret: *filling

[19:23] Margaret: My brain is acting like a weird jelly today. Tomorrow it will be tender muscle, I promise

[19:26] Margaret: Getting back to serious stuff.

[19:27] Margaret: (I’m on the mat right know, as you said before, rest and some yoga)

[19:34] Margaret: Sometimes I do forget that other person do not see my face when we text. Especially when I’m shouting my brain and just going with emotions.

So I’m glad that you’ve checked cuz when I was smiling to screen you were on the other side of the chart. And that’s not cool.

[19:36] Margaret: Another thing that just came to my mind is that our cup are on another lvls today.  And how important is to check this out. 

Btw, when you feel emotionally drained, are you able to work?

[19:41] Margaret: Our’s cups*

[19:41] Margaret: Margaret, better do not write anymore

[19:41] Margaret: Hahahah

[19:46] Margaret: Regarding Naval, nicely combined! I will stole it for Sundays reflections. I feel like I need to optimize more my week. Or another words simplify it.

[19:47] Margaret: May I have a question? I know that I went to your head but I want more.

[19:47] Margaret: Pardon. You invited me 😇

[19:49] Margaret: Okey, now I finished my monologue. I will do some headstands to transform my brain from this jelly mode.

[19:49] Margaret: Sleep well!

[21:35] You: Maybe you need a very empathetic mentor 😂

[21:36] You: You will command your brain? Wow, what a skill 🌚

[21:39] You: what do you refer to with this cups analogy? :) 

No, when I’m emotionally drained I’m not effective and most of the work comes with suffering.

So I try to restrain from it. 

This is important because my mental and emotional state affect decision-making. And it’s much more important than a chunk of work.

[21:41] You: so what was your question?  I don’t understand :)

[21:41] You: Yeah, in the headstand position, more blood will come to your brain 🧠 😀


--- 2025-03-08 ---

[08:37] Margaret: Good morning Eugene!
I just wanna say that I feel amazing and I will have amazing day. Hope you have too. That’s the end of the news 😂

I see that there is question missing! I don’t understand why is missing too. So it’s us both. 

You’ve met my ‘ameba’s mind state’ (ameba = jellyfish), you are welcome 😂

[08:39] Margaret: I like when you are referring to your mind/deciding making/getting to know yourself. It’s hot, you know that?

[08:40] Margaret: My question: How are you managing your desires? I’m referring to ‘choose desires wisely and limit them’.

[08:42] Margaret: Beside that, we have few open items in previous conversation, right? I will go back to them, they deserve that.

[08:52] Margaret: 1. Regarding this podcasts, I was referring to NotebookLM. It was weird when they called my an author with my name.
2. I’m going to Malta at the end of this month. My mind is so ready to get lost in the alleys.
3. Question with coin - here I passed. Nothing genius I can’t think of it.
4. On vercel my client has their site, not me yet. But later I will have a question.

[18:56] You: Good evening Margaret!

Wooow, what a gift to the world! I know you had a wonderful day! 

Haha, that we have in common. 

Haha I i think I get the analogy. Jellyfish is adventurous and likes to travel but not sure about its direction. So maybe your mind has such a similarity. But even if so I am sure it’s long gone!

[18:57] You: 🥵

Are you flirting, young lady?

[19:00] You: In regards to desires, I don’t have them a lot. 

Probably that’s a secret. Not a big revelation 😛

[19:01] You: 1. I use Obsidian and Cursor. Do you think I should try NotebookLM?
2.  😍😍😍😍
4. Agreed!

[19:03] You: Yesterday until 11pm I was on a call with my sister creating a demo.

We focused on one niche, the beauty industry (hair, skin, etc). Super excited and already doing idea validation with potential clients!

And today I spent a whole day on the yoga / tantric event about sexuality. It was cool. I have some things to reflect on :)


--- 2025-03-09 ---

[10:24] Margaret: I’ve open your messages at 1 am, yes 1am 😂 I have some sleeping troubles recently. And kinda felt like I don’t have capacity to respond properly. 

Yesterday was more than great but ended pretty emotional for me. My body was drained. Funny story that I lied for 40 minutes on acupressure mat and after that I didn’t know on what planet I am. Really! 😂

[10:28] Margaret: Am I flirting? Hmm… I haven’t started yet. Trust me 😏

I like eating this/you by small spoon. Not big chunks which you could easily choked.

[10:33] Margaret: Desires. Here you have shocked me. Or maybe no? I’m thinking… in my understanding desires are short term/ moment related pleasures.

I can’t think of any long term desires. Interesting for me, cuz I’ve never think of them like this.

[10:41] Margaret: Regarding AI tools, I’m not here to advise! But have to say that I like work with NotebookLM to summarize/etiquette my reflections. This way, I feel like I’m going even deeper. 

Obsidian’s mind map is fantastic, being able to see it all connected, oh dear lord! I was trying to use it, but I guess it’s not my type of system.

[10:50] Margaret: Wow, have already had potential clients? That’s so smooth. I recently thought about this (after seeing your landing), and I don’t know why but Booksy came to my mind. 

Am curious if somehow they don’t adding another service AI based to their offer.

[10:54] Margaret: Whole day spiritual/sexual event. Your Sunday will be more than interesting. I’m sure 😎 

Yoga did such a great job in my sexual life. My ‘hips never lie’ after daily practice and trauma release.

[12:12] You: Ah, I saw a notification that you liked one of my messages. So that’s how it was :) 

I felt in a similar way yesterday!

[12:14] You: Conscious eating is good for sensual pleasure and the digestive system haha

[12:15] You: Desire = goal, don’t they?

Basically you want something (desire) and you make it your goal.

[12:19] You: I'm trying NotebookLM right now. Curious to see how you use it!

[12:19] You: I need to do more cust dev…So I might ask you some questions tomorrow.

Will you help me? :)

[12:21] You: It’s sooo interesting. I thought I’ll get a day off, but was working all that time! 

There is a saying.

“If you want to get freedom, start your own thing. 

You’ll get your freedom…Freedom to work whenever you are 24/7
“

🤌

[12:23] You: Can you elaborate on hips part? 

Really interesting, because yesterday I had diverse sensations

[12:44] You: I actually converted all my md notes into llm-digestible format and will now try to speak with notebookllm about them :)

about 1mil token of notes 😫

[13:24] Margaret: Maybe yesterday had emotional ‘spice’ from default? 

Who knows.

[13:28] Margaret: From my perspective, we have a little misunderstanding 😇

I would love to discuss about llms but my skills are limiting me right know. I can elaborate on modifying genome or metabolic pathways in a cell. But I’m not a dev. I like to be close to tech, it excites me and it’s such a leverage. 

But that all. 
So in my feeling, you are a person who might want help me 😂 Do you agree?

[13:34] Margaret: Or maybe… now are you flirting with me?

[13:35] Margaret: I’m good at reading people (intuition) but have too little data yet ;)

[13:39] Margaret: What kind of sensations? I’ve never been on such an event. Sounds intriguing, so one hundred sure that I will try but… when I’m thinking about it my head is kinda empty,

[13:41] Margaret: Do you want to elaborate on my hips? I hope we will be actively elaborating on therm tomorrow at pilates classes 😌

[13:42] Margaret: 1mln tokens? Sounds expensive or time consuming. Haven’t decided yet.

[13:43] Margaret: Offtop. If we could export our conversation from Tinder. That would be gold!

[13:51] Margaret: Me 2 h ago: let’s go for a walk, I hate that I don’t feel alive today. 
Me now: I’m heading home with pistachio doughnut from my fav pastry shop. And I’m not into sweets right know. But I needed to visit this shop 😂

[13:52] Margaret: Meanwhile you: working aka making money and playing with llm.

[13:52] Margaret: Sundays just hits different!

[13:57] You: I'm not working anymore, Dobby needs a break 🙊

I'm doing the same right now actually. Looking into pastry though I’m not into sweets right now 😂

[13:58] You: I'll reply to the rest when I accomplish this mission!
